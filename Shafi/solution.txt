I have created a chat application with Java, Jersey, Jax RS, REST Assured(Unit Testing).

I have created a maven archetype application using Eclipse IDE

This application is like a simple twitter application, where a user can post a feed, and other user can comment to it.

I have created these with error pages to handle the exceptions.

Here, I have created CRUD for Message,User and Comments.

So the application is like a message posting app. Where one can message and others can comment on those messages.

I have created a DatabaseClass which is used a stub to store messages and users.

This is full and full a Java REST application.

So i have properly mentioned a end points for this application.

I have also tested every rest API with the rest client called "POSTMAN".	

Note: I have not created a client - server chat or any socket application using TCP/IP
